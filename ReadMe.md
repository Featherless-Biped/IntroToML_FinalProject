Absolutely. Here is a **clean, copy-pasteable `README.md`** that tells you exactly how to create a virtual environment and how to run the project:

# 🧠 Intro to ML - Final Project

This project trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict mortgage loan approvals using `train.csv` and `test.csv`. It uses scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and more.

---

## ✅ Setup Instructions (with Virtual Environment)

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
````

### 2. Activate the Environment

* **Windows (Command Prompt):**

  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* **macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Upgrade pip

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 4. Install All Required Packages

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib xgboost catboost lightgbm
```

> These are the **only external packages** you need. All are installable via `pip`.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Add Data Files

Make sure the following files are in your `Project/` directory:

* `train.csv`
* `test.csv`

> ⚠️ These are **not included** in the repo and must be added manually.

---

### 2. Run the Code

You can run the main script in either of these ways:

* 📓 **Via Jupyter Notebook:**
  Open the notebook and run all cells.

* 🐍 **Or as a Python script:**
  If you moved all your model functions into a `.py` file, run:

  ```bash
  python your_script.py
  ```

---

### 3. Output Files

After execution, you will see:

* `results/*.csv`: Final predictions for submission
* `models/*.pkl`: Saved model files
* `logs/model_log.csv`: Logged AUC scores for all models

---

## 📦 Optional: Export Your Environment

If needed, save your environment as a `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

And install later with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
